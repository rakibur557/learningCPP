    Topic: Class & Object
    Class: collections of various objects is known as class.
    A class is a template from which individual object can be created
    class: student{
    id
    GPA
    }
    Now we can declaring object.:
    student Alim;  // here student is a class ans it works like data type
    student Rakib; // Rakib is a variable of student data type

    What is Object?
    If anything has state/ variable and behavior/function
    Any class type variable is called an object

    For Example:

    Object: Alim{
    id: 212121
    GPA: 3.98
    }
    Object: Rakib
    id: 369369
    GPA: 3.92
